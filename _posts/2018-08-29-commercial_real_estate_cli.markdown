My CLI project scrapes a major commercial real estate search website and provides users with a list of property locations. After the list of properties is returned, users can select a property (level one) and view details (i.e. location, cost, size) about the selected location (level two.)

The site I scraped is called [Loopnet](http://www.loopnet.com/). Loopnet is a Zillow-like commercial real estate search platform that returns thousands of properties for a user based on geographic and property specific queries. A command line interface that returns all of Loopnet’s property information would be beneficial to real estate companies interested in merging an internal database with the data provided by services like Loopnet. While the functionality of my CLI doesn’t come close to achieving the full scope of value described above, the experience of developing a small CLI from scratch was challenging and gratifying.
